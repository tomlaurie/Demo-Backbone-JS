# Backbone JS Demo - Calorie Counter

Version 1.0, September 8th, 2016.

### General Usage Notes

- Load the index.html file into your web browser and ensure you are connected to the Internet.  Enter a food type in the search box and click the search button to return calorific information about that particular food.
- Selecting an amount of a particular food in the search results and clicking the "Add to Basket" button adds the amount of the selected food to a running total of calories.
- To view items in the basket, click the "Basket" button. To update the number of items, change the number in the input box and click the "Update" button.  To remove an entry, click the "Remove" button.
- To return to the search results from the basket, use the browser back button.
- Your basket contents are saved in the browser's local storage by default, so they should remain in the basket even in a new browser session.  If this does not happen, you may need to adjust your browser security settings or update your browser.

### Installation Instructions

- Unzip the folder to a directory on your local computer. No installation is required - simply load the index.html page into your web browser.
